# FoodRecomendation   -

**1.** **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

Recommendation system build for the multi – cuisine restaurant.
Model build for existing and New Customer based on previous order and New customer based on food. 
Collecting the data from Primary source(survey).  
Based on the collected data completing the preprocessing(EDA). 
Storing the data in Azure tools. And performing the Recommendation System based on Content based Filtering to find out the recommendation of the food based on the customer historic information based on the ingredients preferred.
The prediction would be suggesting  the recommended food to the customer. 
This will be automatically performed based on the Machine learning model.

**PROJECT SCOPE**

The Vendor can efficiently predict customer recommended food orders which is faster, more efficiently and cost effectively based on historical data. 
Predictive analysis helps decision makers in designing new recommendation strategies based on food orders which will help in customer improvement as well as overall growth to the business.

**2.** **Business Objective:** 

The business objective to build a recommendation model to predict the recommended food based on customer exiting details or  food mostly preferred by other customers for a multi cuisine restaurant.

  Maximize:  Preferred food options to customer to increase the profits in business

**Business Constraints:** 

	Recommending the customer's food based on previous order.
